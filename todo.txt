TODO:

- add support for youtube playlist
- download songs that are in the queue in the background to increase the speed by A LOT!!!
- use cogs

SUPPORT FOR YOUTUBE PLAYLISTS:

with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(YDL_OPTIONS) as ydl:
    video = ydl.extract_info("https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr5OsF2umninLmW-yux0oONqNaQiIpJhw", download=False)

create list containing the video urls of the playlist
playlist_items = []

for i in video['entries']:
    playlist_items.append(i['webpage_url'])



where webpage_url is all the video urls in the playlist, in order.
check if the string "list" is in arg. if yes, set isPlaylist to true. use global vars
if is_Playlist:
  then we download the first video, and use after and the function and download the next and the next and if the list is empty, we just stop
else:
  everything else



VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!!
when a normal video is added, FIRST play the entire playlist and then play the queue.
so maybe if playlist_items.len(0):
  then do normal shit, and set isplaying_playlist to false
else:
  set isplaying_playlist to true and first play entire playlist and then the queue.
  also set isplaying_playlist to false after playlist is empty
